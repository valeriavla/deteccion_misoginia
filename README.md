## Summary:
Sentiment analysis is an area of ​​study that involves the use and management of information for the detection of moods, emotions and attitudes, expressed in text and search determine a person's attitude related to objects, services, places, events or topics specific.

With the exponential growth of microblogging platforms, it has increased with them violence against women through the replication of hate speech, promoting misogynistic culture with which we live every day. Although recently there has been great effort to identify misogyny automatically, it is still difficult to distinguish it between sexism or aggressive language towards women due to its subtlety and strong social context that entails. Until now, most analyzes of this problem focus on texts in English and the small amount of analysis with texts in Spanish does not distinguish its place of origin complicating classification due to cultural and linguistic differences within the same language.

In this thesis work, a dataset of tweets in Spanish labeled as "misogynistic" or not was collected. Furthermore a linguistic analysis is carried out on a corpus of opinions in Mexican Spanish. Various preprocessing techniques are implemented to said corpus. Finally, through tools and libraries such as “Spaceling”, “Freeling” and “NLTK” to train a supervised classifier capable of discerning whether an opinion known as a “Tweet” is misogynistic or not.
